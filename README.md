# console-log package

console-log is a simple helper function that makes logging and debugging easy.

## How to use

can be used by using the hotkeys ```ctrl-l```

## Features

* **empty console.log function :** mimics ```log-tab``` functionality. When the hotkey ```ctrl-l``` is used anywhere in the editor without any selection it will add ```console.log()``` to the editor. (refer line 6 in gif)

* **filled in console.log function :** if you want to console.log a specific variable, constant or value in your code, just select the value and click the hotkey ```ctrl-l```. A console.log function with an identifier of the selected value in caps and the value will be added to a new line (so as not to break existing code), and will be indented to the same number of spaces as the previous line. (refer line 8 in gif)

* **Deconsole your file :** enable quick  cleaning of your file after you are done debugging.
