# console-log package

console-log is a simple  and smart helper function that makes logging and debugging easy.
**New Config options added**

## Features (click for demo)
### Basic Logging
* ```ctrl-l``` (OSX) or ```ctrl-alt-l``` (Linux/Windows) - [Generates a console.log with identifier if text/variable is selected, and empty console.log if no text is selected.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/console-log-demo.gif)
* ```ctrl-o``` (OSX) or ```ctrl-alt-o``` (Linux/Windows) - [Generates a console.log with text/variable within a JSON.stringify method.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/console-log-stringify-demo.gif)

### Smart Object Logging (Incremental improvements in works)
* [If selected text is the variable being defined to create an object, places console.log after object has been created to prevent any code breaks.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/console-log-object-demo.gif)

### Smart Function Logging (Early release still in works)
* [If function name is selected, places console.log after function has been created. If param is selected, places the console.log statement within the param](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/console-log-function-demo.gif)

### Smart Conditionals Logging (early release)
* [if a variable used in a definition of the conditional in an if statement is logged, the insert is placed on the line above the if statement and a 'CONDITION PASSED' insert in the if statement, so that the logging is not lost if the condition doesn't pass, and there is clear validation if the condition passed. For subsequent chained conditionals, insert is placed within the conditional.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/console-log-conditional-demo.gif)

### Logging Cleanup
* ```ctrl-shift-D``` - [clean out all the lines that contain console.log statements in the file.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/deconsoler-demo.gif)

### Identifier Styling (Chrome Dev Tools only)
**Note:- This functionality will only work for selected text**
* ```ctrl-alt-c``` (plain insert) or ```ctrl-alt-s``` (JSON.stringify insert) - [For logging in the chrome dev tools console, you can choose to enable text styling for the identifier](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishysank/console-log-atom/master/assets/styling-demo.png)
